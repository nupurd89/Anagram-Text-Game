This is a text game like the NYT Spelling Bee Word game. 

It gives you 6 letters and you have to make all the words possible using those letters and a special letter. 
It awards you points based on how long the word is. At the end, it lists out every word you entered and
your total amount of points. 

Next steps:
1. Add a level system
2. Make a GUI thru PyGame
